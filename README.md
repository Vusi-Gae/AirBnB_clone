Dcription of the project

AirBnB_clone is a Python project that aims to recreate the basic functionalities of the popular online accommodation marketplace, Airbnb, through a console application. This project allows users to interact with a simplified version of Airbnb's services using a command-line interface.

Description of the command interpreter:
The interface of the application is just like the Bash shell except that this has a limited number of accepted commands that were solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website.

This command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.

Some of the commands available are:

show
create
update
destroy
count

And as part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with the backend and file storage system, the folowing actions can be performed:

Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Updating attributes of an object
Destroying an object

How to start it
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine (Linux distro) for development and testing purposes.

Installing
You will need to clone the repository of the project from Github. This will contain the simple shell program and all of its dependencies. After cloning the repository you will have a folder called AirBnB_clone. In here there will be several files that allow the program to work.

How to use it
It can work in two different modes:

Interactive and Non-interactive.

In Interactive mode, the console will display a prompt (hbnb) indicating that the user can write and execute a command. After the command is run, the prompt will appear again a wait for a new command. This can go indefinitely as long as the user does not exit the program.

In Non-interactive mode, the shell will need to be run with a command input piped into its execution so that the command is run as soon as the Shell starts. In this mode no prompt will appear, and no further input will be expected from the user.
